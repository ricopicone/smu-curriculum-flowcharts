# smu-curriculum-flowcharts

This repository contains the source code for generating curriculum flowcharts for the Saint Martin's University (SMU) Department of Mechanical Engineering.

The project is written in Python and relies on Graphviz. Required Python packages can be installed using the following command.

```console
pip install -r requirements
```

Now install Graphviz itself from [here](http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php). With homebrew on macOS, the following command should work.

```console
brew install graphviz
```
